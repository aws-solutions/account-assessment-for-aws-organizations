```

### Unit Test

Run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests.

```
cd ./source
chmod +x ./run-all-tests.sh
./run-all-tests.sh
cd ..
```

_âœ… Ensure all unit tests pass. Review the generated coverage report_

### Build

To build your customized distributable follow given steps.

- Pick a unique bucket name, `e.g. account-assessment-staging`. Set it as an environment variable on your terminal.

```shell
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=account-assessment-staging-$(date +%s)
```

- In your AWS account, create a bucket with this name __appended with the deployment region__,
  e.g. `account-assessment-staging-us-east-1`. (At deployment time, the webui distributable will be copied from that
  bucket to the
  created hosting bucket.)

```shell
export REGION=us-east-1
ASSET_BUCKET_NAME=$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION
aws s3 mb s3://$ASSET_BUCKET_NAME/
```

- Configure the solution name, version number and deployment region as environment variables on your terminal as well

```shell
export SOLUTION_NAME=account-assessment-for-aws-organizations
export SOLUTION_VERSION=v1.1
```

- Build the distributable using build-s3-dist.sh

```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $SOLUTION_VERSION
cd ..
```


### Deploy

Prerequisite: In your Org Management Account, enable sharing Resource Access Manager with your AWS Organization. (AWS
Console -> Resource Access Manager -> Settings)

Deploy the distributables to the S3 bucket in your account

```
export BUCKET_NAME=$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION
aws s3 ls s3://$BUCKET_NAME # test bucket exists - should not give an error
cd ./deployment
aws s3 cp global-s3-assets/  s3://$BUCKET_NAME/$SOLUTION_NAME/$SOLUTION_VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control --profile <PROFILE_NAME>
aws s3 cp regional-s3-assets/  s3://$BUCKET_NAME/$SOLUTION_NAME/$SOLUTION_VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control --profile <PROFILE_NAME>
```

_âœ… All assets are now staged on your S3 bucket. You or any user may use S3 links for deployments_

Determine the parameter values that you want to deploy the stacks with:

- DeploymentNamespace: An arbitrary value that is shared by Hub Stack and OrgMgmt Stack and Spoke Stack.
- UserEmail: The email address for the first Cognito User which the deployment creates.
- AllowListedIPRanges: CIDR blocks to permit API access. To allow any IP, use 0.0.0.0/1,128.0.0.0/1
- HubAccountId: The AccountId of your AWS Account you are deploying the Hub Stack to.

PROFILE_HUB, PROFILE_SPOKE, PROFILE_ORG_MGMT are the AWS CLI profiles on your machine that determines AccountId and
Region to deploy to. We recommend to choose an account as PROFILE_HUB that is different from your Org Management
Account.
Each account in your AWS Organization that you intend to scan wit this solution is a spoke account and needs a
deployment of the spoke template.

In case your accounts have not been bootstrapped for cdk yet, run:

```
cd ./source
npm run bootstrap -- --profile <PROFILE_HUB>
npm run bootstrap -- --profile <PROFILE_SPOKE>
npm run bootstrap -- --profile <PROFILE_ORG_MGMT>
cd ..
```

With the values determined above, run the following commands:

```
cd ./source/infra
npm run deploy -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters UserEmail=<EMAIL>  --parameters AllowListedIPRanges=<IP-RANGES> --parameters OrganizationID=<ORD_ID> --profile <PROFILE_HUB>
npm run deploySpoke -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters HubAccountId=<HUB_ACCOUNT_ID> --profile <PROFILE_SPOKE>
npm run deployOrgMgmt -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters HubAccountId=<HUB_ACCOUNT_ID> --profile <PROFILE_ORG_MGMT>
cd ../..
```

### Faster development cycles

Once you have built and deployed the complete solution once, you may want to shorten the cycle times for iterative
development.

#### Frontend development

- Download the file `aws-exports-generated.json` from your WebUIHostingBucket that was created during the first
  deployment.
- Place the file in `/source/webui/public`
- Replace the generated values of the following properties in the file to point to localhost:

```      
"redirectSignIn": "http://localhost:3000/",
"redirectSignOut": "http://localhost:3000/",
```

Start the web ui react app locally. It will use Cognito and API Gateway in your Hub Account as the backend.

```
cd ./source/webui
npm run start
```

#### Backend development

When you make changes to the lambda function code only (`source/lambda`), you may want to package and deploy the lambda
code without building the webui. For that, run the following commands with the parameter values determined above:

```
cd ./source/infra
npm run buildLambdaAndDeploy -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters UserEmail=<EMAIL>  --parameters AllowListedIPRanges=<IP-RANGES> --profile <PROFILE_HUB>
cd ..
```

This will replace the file `deployment/regional-s3-assets/lambda.zip` from your initial build with a new package of your
modified source code and its dependencies, retaining `deployment/regional-s3-assets/webui` from the initial build.

#### CDK development

Should you make changes to the CDK app code only, and neither webui nor lambda code, it is sufficient to run:

```
cd ./source
npm run deploy -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters UserEmail=<EMAIL>  --parameters AllowListedIPRanges=<IP-RANGES> --parameters OrganizationID=<ORD_ID> --profile <PROFILE_HUB>
cd ..
```

This will update your hub stack with the changed resources, but use the unchanged webui and lambda code in
`deployment/regional-s3-assets` from the initial build.
