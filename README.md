### Unit Test

Run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests.

```
cd ./source
chmod +x ./run-all-tests.sh
./run-all-tests.sh
cd ..
```

_âœ… Ensure all unit tests pass. Review the generated coverage report_

### Build

To build your customized distributable follow given steps.

- Configure the solution name, version number and bucket name as environment variables
- At deployment time, the webui distributable will be copied from DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET to the created hosting bucket.
  Replace `solutions-features` by your own bucket name, if you make changes to the web ui.

```
SOLUTION_NAME=AccountAssessment
DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=solutions-features
VERSION=custom001
```

- Build the distributable using build-s3-dist.sh

```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
cd ..
```

- If you customized the web ui, upload the folder `webui` from `deployment/regional-s3-assets` to your own s3 bucket.
  Replace `solutions-features` in package.json by yor own bucket name.

### Deploy

Determine the parameter values that you want to deploy the stacks with:

- DeploymentNamespace: An arbitrary value that is shared by Hub Stack and OrgMgmt Stack and Spoke Stack.
- CognitoDomainPrefix: An arbitrary, globally unique value to prefix the login page url.
- UserEmail: The email address for the first Cognito User which the deployment creates.
- AllowListedIPRanges: CIDR blocks to permit API access. To allow any IP, use 0.0.0.0/1,128.0.0.0/1
- HubAccountId: The AccountId of your AWS Account you are deploying the Hub Stack to.

PROFILE_HUB, PROFILE_SPOKE, PROFILE_ORG_MGMT are the AWS CLI profiles on your machine that determines AccountId and
Region to deploy to. We recommend to choose an account as PROFILE_HUB that is different from your Org Management
Account.
Each account in your AWS Organization that you intend to scan wit this solution is a spoke account and needs a
deployment of the spoke template.

In case your accounts have not been bootstrapped for cdk yet, run:

```
cd ./source
npm run bootstrap -- --profile <PROFILE_HUB>
npm run bootstrap -- --profile <PROFILE_SPOKE>
npm run bootstrap -- --profile <PROFILE_ORG_MGMT>
cd ..
```

With the values determined above, run the following commands:

```
cd ./source
npm run deploy -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters CognitoDomainPrefix=<PREFIX> --parameters UserEmail=<EMAIL>  --parameters AllowListedIPRanges=<IP-RANGES> --profile <PROFILE_HUB>
npm run deploySpoke -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters HubAccountId=<HUB_ACCOUNT_ID> --profile <PROFILE_SPOKE>
npm run deployOrgMgmt -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters HubAccountId=<HUB_ACCOUNT_ID> --profile <PROFILE_ORG_MGMT>
cd ..
```

### Faster development cycles

Once you have built and deployed the complete solution once, you may want to shorten the cycle times for iterative
development.

#### Frontend development

- Download the file `aws-exports-generated.json` from your WebUIHostingBucket that was created during the first
  deployment.
- Place the file in `/source/webui/public`
- Replace the generated values of the following properties in the file to point to localhost:

```      
"redirectSignIn": "http://localhost:3000/",
"redirectSignOut": "http://localhost:3000/",
```

Start the web ui react app locally. It will use Cognito and API Gateway in your Hub Account as the backend.

```
cd ./source/webui
npm run start
```

#### Backend development

When you make changes to the lambda function code only (`source/lambda`), you may want to package and deploy the lambda
code without building the webui. For that, run the following commands with the parameter values determined above:

```
cd ./source
npm run buildLambdaAndDeploy -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters CognitoDomainPrefix=<PREFIX> --parameters UserEmail=<EMAIL>  --parameters AllowListedIPRanges=<IP-RANGES> --profile <PROFILE_HUB>
cd ..
```

This will replace the file `deployment/regional-s3-assets/lambda.zip` from your initial build with a new package of your
modified source code and its dependencies, retaining `deployment/regional-s3-assets/webui` from the initial build.

#### CDK development

Should you make changes to the CDK app code only, and neither webui nor lambda code, it is sufficient to run:

```
cd ./source
npm run deploy -- --parameters DeploymentNamespace=<NAMESPACE> --parameters CognitoDomainPrefix=<PREFIX> --parameters UserEmail=<EMAIL>  --parameters AllowListedIPRanges=<IP-RANGES> --profile <PROFILE_HUB>
cd ..
```

This will update your hub stack with the changed resources, but use the unchanged webui and lambda code in
`deployment/regional-s3-assets` from the initial build.
